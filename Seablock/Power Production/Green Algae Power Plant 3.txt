Required tech
Red Algae Processing (for algae farm 3)
Boiler 2, Steam Engine 2
Steel furnaces
Automation 2 (there's one assembler 2 in it for building count)

8/min mineralized water and 8/min CO2 for 3.4935MJ of power. Burns charcoal.
This one runs on boilers but you can easily convert to an 2x2 array of burners with four of those.
Yeah, it's just under one boiler 2. The furnace fuel and CO2 have already been included in the calculations though. Make an extra farm, I guess.
